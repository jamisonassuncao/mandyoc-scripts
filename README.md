# Simple scripts for Mandyoc

This repository contains two main `.ipynb` scripts for the Mandyoc code. 

The `mandyoc-make-initial.ipynb` creates an initial subduction scenario for Mandyoc to simulate.

The `mandyoc-plot.ipynb` plots and creates a movie of any Mandyoc simulated scenario.

The scripts were built with Jupyter Lab and its environment can be replicated with `conda` by using
```
conda env create -f env-mandyoc.yml
```
